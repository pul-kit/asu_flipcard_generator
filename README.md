**Flipcard Generator**
To design flipcards that are styled differently, use Articulate Storyline!

**HOW TO GENERATE FLIPCARDS:**
 1. Go to GitHub [https://github.com/pul-kit/asu_flipcard_generator/blob/main/flipcard_generator.html] and download the flipcard_generator HTML file.
 2. Open the downloaded flipcard_generator.html.
 3. Upload an image for the landing page of the flipcard.
      1. I generally use an image specifically created for the course the flipcard is for.
 4. Choose the theme of the flipcard. Orange or Blue.
 5. Choose how many flipcards you want the interactive to have.
 6. For each flipcard, you will see a front field and a back field. Fill those out.
 7. Click the "Generate HTML" button. Once you click, the "Download HTML" button should appear.
 8. Click the "Download HTML" button.
 9. Open the downloaded file to view your flipcard.
 10. If everything looks good, upload to cloud and embed in your course!
