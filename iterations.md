**Possible iterations?**

Maybe add an AE theme (Maroon/Gold)?
Allow users to choose colors?
Allow users to edit the sentences on the landing page?
Perhaps make 5, 7 flipcards all the same size?
Make the landing page optional?
Add a default graphic to be used if the user doesn't upload one?
Should there be a character limit?
Apply the lowest font size to all cards in the same interactive?
